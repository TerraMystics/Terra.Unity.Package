Please also make sure to install the following [dependency](https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity/wiki/Install-official-via-UPM) package into your project too.

## Usage

### Manage Payments

Please note: **PaymentsManager** must be registered as a Singleton to prevent issues with the Connection Pool.

```cs
void ProcessPaymentForTerra() {
     string businessWallet = "terra17lmam6zguazs5q5u6z5mmx76uj63gldnse2pdp"; // Wallet where customer payments will be transferred to
     string customerRecoveryWords = "notice oak worry limit wrap speak medal online prefer cluster roof addict wrist behave treat actual wasp year salad speed social layer crew genius"; // Recovery Words of the Customer wallet that will be making the payment

     // Configure your PaymentManager
     // Set Blockchain to target (in this case Classic)
     var paymentsManager = new PaymentsManager(TerraEnvironment.Classic)
                               .ConfigureBusinessWallet(businessWallet) // Configure your Business Wallet
                               .ConfigureCustomerWallet(customerRecoveryWords); // Configure the Customer Wallet

     var simulation = await paymentsManager.SimulateChargeCustomer(100);
     await DisplayAlert("Successful Transaction", $"Gas Wanted: {simulation.GasWanted}, \n Gas Used: {simulation.GasUsed}", "Ok");
